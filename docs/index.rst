Welcome to the de.NBI - CeBiTec Nanopore Workshop 2020!
=======================================================
Best Practice and SARS-CoV-2 applications
-----------------------------------------

Welcome to the three-day nanopore Hands-On training course. This tutorial will guide you through the typical steps of the analysis of ONT sequencing data ranging from basecalling, quality assessment over assembly to sequence polishing and finally assembly evaluation. A focus in this workshop is on the analysis of Nanopore sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes and a suitable workflow for resequencing based on the ARTIC bioinformatics protocol.
