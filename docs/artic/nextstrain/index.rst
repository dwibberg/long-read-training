Nextstrain
==========

Nextstrain is an open-source project to harness the scientific and public health potential of pathogen genome data. It provides a continually-updated view of publicly available data alongside powerful analytic and visualization tools for use by the community. The goal is to aid epidemiological understanding and improve outbreak response. 

Nextstrain can also be installed locally and is already installed in your Virtual Machine. We are going to start Nextstrain with an example SARS-Cov2 dataset provided by nextstrain. Then we will include our own data.
